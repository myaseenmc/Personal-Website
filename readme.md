# Demo Portfolio — Muhammed Yaseen MC

A simple, responsive demo portfolio template created by Muhammed Yaseen MC. This repository contains a small static website you can use as a starting point for a personal portfolio or showcase.

Note: This README was produced with the assistance of an AI to help document and guide usage. Review and adapt any suggestions to fit your needs.

## What this project contains

- `index.html` — the homepage layout (hero, about, skills, projects summary, contact section).
- `style.css` — site styles and responsive rules.
- `script.js` — small interactive behaviors (progress bar animations, form handling, etc.).
- `assets/` — images and other static assets (e.g., `profile.png`).

## Key features

- Lightweight, static HTML/CSS/JS site.
- Responsive layout suitable for desktop and mobile.
- Animated skills progress bars and a contact form scaffold.
- Easy to customize: swap copy, replace images, adjust styles.

## Quick start

1. Clone or download this repository to your machine.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to preview the site.


## How to customize

- Replace text in `index.html` and `projects.html` with your own name, bio, and content.
- Swap images in the `assets/` folder (update `<img>` `src` paths if you rename files).
- Edit `style.css` to change colors, fonts, spacing, or layout.
- Update `script.js` to change animations or wire the contact form to an email/API.

Accessibility and best-practices tips

- Add `role="progressbar"` and appropriate `aria-` attributes to animated progress bars for screen readers.
- Add `alt` text to images in `assets/` for accessibility.
- Use semantic tags and ensure form fields include labels and proper validation messages.
